Installation and configuration of OpenDNSSEC
============================================
OpenDNSSEC is available at https://www.opendnssec.org/

### Installation and configuration instructions for Ubuntu 11.10
When we set up our test environment we used instructions given to us from Rickard Bellgrim from Certezza AB which he has used when giving introductions to OpenDNSSEC.
These instructions are available in this repository as "opendnssec.exercises.2012.03.pdf" next to this file.
To be able to follow and understand what is happening in that guide basic to intermediate understanding of the DNS system and Bind is required.
