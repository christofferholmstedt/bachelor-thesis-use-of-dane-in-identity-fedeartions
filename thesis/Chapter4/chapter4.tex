\section{How to combine Identity federations and DANE}
As stated earlier it's possible to divide federations into two categories, those with a federation provider and those without.
In the analysis that has been done the solution with a federation provider is the most probable and viable setup in the long run, it's basiclly much easier to scale, both technically and non-technically.
It's with this configuration in mind the following evaluation will be made.

%TODO: (1) Kontrollera att det finns information om b책da kategorierna av federationer.
%TODO: (2) Kontrollera att analys 채r gjord och att det verkligen 채r varianten med en FO som 채r mest trolig.

EVALUATION This is where you put the spotlight on your solution's strengths and
weaknesses. An evaluation must be made of the methods/theory applied and the validity
and reliability of the data. You should describe the most interesting results of your work in a
results section. Remember that less important but complementary results can to advantage
be placed in appendices. A rule of thumb is that all results that you use in your analysis and
in your conclusions should be reported in the Evaluation chapter and the rest reported in
appendices.
