EVALUATION This is where you put the spotlight on your solution's strengths and
weaknesses. An evaluation must be made of the methods/theory applied and the validity
and reliability of the data. You should describe the most interesting results of your work in a
results section. Remember that less important but complementary results can to advantage
be placed in appendices. A rule of thumb is that all results that you use in your analysis and
in your conclusions should be reported in the Evaluation chapter and the rest reported in
appendices.
