DISCUSSION Your conclusions, where you link your findings to your theories and purpose,
will discuss whether you achieved your purpose and what opportunities exist for further
development. An analysis and interpretation of your results may often correspond to the
frame of reference and the theoretical models you have used. Using models, checklists etc,
you broke down your task into manageable questions. Now you reverse your approach and
use them to build general conclusions and recommendations that correspond to your
purpose and your client's decision situation.
