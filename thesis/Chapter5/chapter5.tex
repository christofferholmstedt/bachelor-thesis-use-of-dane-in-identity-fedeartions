\section{Do this solve our question?}
% TODO: Make comments about that if we can secure the transmission of Metadata between all entities (FOs, IdPs, AAs, SPs and Discos) we can deem that the data integrity of all messages transmitted between them(the entities) is not lost or tampered with. As long as all entities do a proper check for each SAML2 message.

\section{How to continue with further research}
\subsection{Communication with a federation provider}
The communication between the federation provider and the other entities such as identity providers and service providers has no standardized way in how it should work.
How does the federation provider know that it really is the right identity provider it's talking with without any prior communication?
Should the federation provider be the one that initiate connection to the other entities or vice versa?
Last, but no least, how should this be solved technically to minimize the manual labour and automate as much as possible?

DISCUSSION Your conclusions, where you link your findings to your theories and purpose,
will discuss whether you achieved your purpose and what opportunities exist for further
development. An analysis and interpretation of your results may often correspond to the
frame of reference and the theoretical models you have used. Using models, checklists etc,
you broke down your task into manageable questions. Now you reverse your approach and
use them to build general conclusions and recommendations that correspond to your
purpose and your client's decision situation.
