For many years we have built trust in our society with personal idenfication cards such as passports and driver licenses, we can validate each other's identity with a signature and a picture.
Most online services require authentication before you get access to them, some require just a password while others require alot more before they can trust you.
Identity federations is one way to build similiar trust online as the identification cards give us offline.
As we all know a system is as weak as its weakest link, so all parts of an identity federation must meet some minimum assurance level.
This report is about how DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities can improve one of the identity federations weakest links.
