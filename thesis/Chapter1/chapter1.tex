\section{Background}
The topic of this thesis was chosen after a discussion with Staffan Hagnell(.SE), Jakob Schlyter(Kirei) and Carl Ljungqvist(Certezza).
Interesting topics are most of the time found at the leading edge of research, this was also true with this thesis. The discussion started out with trying to find a current problem with DNSSEC that would be suitable for a thesis.

\section{Problem description}

\section{Purpose}
The purpose with this theasis is to show proof of concept, that DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities) can be used to improve security aswell as the usage of DNSSEC (DNS Security Extenstions), since DANE is depending on the use of DNSSEC.

\section{Project delimitations}
In the sections above, DNSSEC is mentioned, there will be no detailed review in this report on how it works, the focus is on DANE and Identity Federations.
