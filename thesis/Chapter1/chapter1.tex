\section{Background}
The topic of this thesis was chosen after a discussion with Staffan Hagnell(.SE), Jakob Schlyter(Kirei) and Carl Ljungqvist(Certezza).
Interesting topics are most of the time found at the leading edge of research, this was also true with this thesis. The discussion started out with trying to find a current problem with DNSSEC that would be suitable for a thesis.
