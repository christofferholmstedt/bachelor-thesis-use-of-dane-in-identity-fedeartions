%Appendix A (appendixA.tex)
%APPENDIX For example a User's Guide, some program code, long derivations, and
%evidence. Appendix pages are not to be numbered as part of the report. The headings must
%naturally be in line with the contents of the different sections; otherwise the contents will
%appear somewhat dull.

\section{TEMP Section}
%TODO Here is a "nocite" latex command that needs to be removed when final printing is to be done. The nocite command below include all references in our bibliography but it's not certain if we have used them all.
This text finishes with a reference to our fake reference.
In the references list all references above this one is used in our text and all others are orphans to be removed if we don't need them later on.\cite{fake}
