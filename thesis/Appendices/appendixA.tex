Appendix A (appendixA.tex)
APPENDIX For example a User's Guide, some program code, long derivations, and
evidence. Appendix pages are not to be numbered as part of the report. The headings must
naturally be in line with the contents of the different sections; otherwise the contents will
appear somewhat dull.

TODO Here is a "nocite" latex command that needs to be removed when final printing is to be done. The nocite command below include all references in our bibliography but it's not certain if we have used them all.
