The preface is the place where you can discuss some personal
experiences with the project. This is also the place where you can
thank people who helped you out.

Personally, I would like to thank all the test pilots who suggested
changes, as well as reported bugs in the template. Keep it up, and
I'll keep maintaining the template!
