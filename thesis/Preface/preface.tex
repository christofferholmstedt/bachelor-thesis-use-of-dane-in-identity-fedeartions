The work was carried out at .SE (The Internet Infrastructure Foundation), at their  Stockholm Office in the spring of 2012, to be more specific, from the end of March to the end of May. It examines how the security in identity federations can be improved by using DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities).

The thesis was chosen because of interest in Internet Security.
