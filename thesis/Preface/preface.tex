It's an interesting world we live in where we are constantly on the move with our cellphones, laptops and other devices online day out and day in, all hours during the day.
With the increase of possibilities online we are eager to find a way to build trust online for even more feature rich online services for all of us as citizens, both in the private and public sector.

This thesis work was carried out at .SE (The Internet Infrastructure Foundation) in Sweden, at their Stockholm office in the spring of 2012, to be more precise, from the end of March to the beginning of June.

The subject for this thesis was chosen because of interest in internet security.
We would like to thank Staffan Hagnell from .SE for giving us this opportunity and for the support on the way to our conclusions.
We would also like to thank Rickard Bellgrim from Certezza AB for giving us much needed help when setting up the testing environment aswell as helping us understand how certificates are used and how identity federations works from a more technical point of view.

From our university, Lule\r{a} University of Technology, we would like to thank our supervisor Ulf Bodin, Department of Computer Science, Electrical and Space Engineering, for guiding us in the right direction when struggling with the thesis and putting words to our conclusions.
We would also like to thank Johan Carlson, Department of Computer Science, Electrical and Space Engineering, for the LaTeX template that we have used for this report. 

As a final note we would like to thank all of you that has supported us in our work but didn't get mentioned above.
Thank you.
