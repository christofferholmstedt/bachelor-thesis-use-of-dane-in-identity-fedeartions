This investigation 

DNS (Domain Name System) is the Internets domain name system, a hierarchic and distributed database that makes it possible to quickly find information about which IP-address (and other information) that is connected to a domain name. \cite[p.~64]{book:guide_dns}

DNSSEC (Domain Name Security Extensions) is a securitylayer added to DNS to secure system against assults like cachingpoisning through signing DNS-data digitaly.\cite[p.~64]{book:guide_dns}
